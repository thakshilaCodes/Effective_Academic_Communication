Hello everyone! Welcome to the first session of your English course. This course is designed as a support system to help students improve their English proficiency, a necessary skill for your future academic journey at SLIIT. The course primarily focuses on speaking skills and will provide you with many enjoyable activities to practice English.
You may have completed your school education in Sinhala or Tamil medium, but now you are at a turning point in life—your university education, where your degree is entirely in English. This means that all your assessments will also be in English. Therefore, we believe this course will help you develop your communication skills, which will ultimately lead to better grades.
Now, let’s discuss the structure of the course. We have done our best to make it more learner-centered by including activities that you can complete at your convenience. However, the lessons are structured step by step, so you cannot skip them. Please note that this is done for your own benefit, as we want you to gain the maximum advantage from this course.
Each lesson will begin by outlining the lesson objectives. It is very important for you to read these objectives carefully, as they provide an overall understanding of what we expect from you at the end of each lesson. The second part of every lesson is a pre-class activity. In this section, you will either watch a video or engage in an interactive activity on a separate app to get an initial idea of the lesson topic.
In the third step, you will be introduced to a brief recorded session conducted by a lecturer. This session provides you with guidelines, rules, and essential information before you practice different aspects of language learning. For example, if the lesson is based on presentation skills, the lecturer will provide you with quality input in a 15–20-minute recorded session.
After watching the recorded session, you will be guided through an individual activity that can be completed at home. Please note that we encourage you to complete this activity immediately after watching the recorded session, as this will help you retain the information and complete the task more effectively.
At the end of the lesson, there will be an online quiz to check whether you have achieved the lesson objectives. Completing this quiz is mandatory, as it allows you to assess your own learning progress in the course.
Each lesson concludes with a summary of the lesson and by giving you an idea of what you are expected to do in the classroom. By the time you attend the class, you will have already learned the lesson, and class time will be dedicated to demonstrating your progress. We believe this well-structured course will help you become a better communicator in the future. However, remember that while we can guide you, the learning process must be completed by you.
Now that you are familiar with the course structure, let’s move on to our first lesson: Getting to Know Each Other. First of all, we’ll pay attention to the lesson objectives. These are the aims of the lesson that we want you to achieve at the end of this lesson. 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Introduce yourself confidently by stating your name, background, and interests.
2.	Use appropriate greetings in formal and informal contexts.
3.	Engage in small talk by asking and responding to basic questions about personal information.
4.	Practice active listening skills to respond appropriately in conversations. """,
