Hello everyone, Welcome to Unit 02 
This lesson introduces basic grammar in spoken English. Before we move on to more advanced topics such as word order and types of sentences, it is important to first understand the fundamental role of grammar in communication. Take a moment to reflect on how you currently structure sentences and recognize areas where you might need improvement.
This lesson will focus on building both accuracy and confidence in forming grammatically correct sentences. We will explore how grammar structures impact meaning and help create clear and effective communication—a key skill for expressing your ideas in English. To start, let’s take a moment to clarify our objectives. Knowing what we aim to accomplish will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the lesson. With that in mind, let’s go over the lesson goals.

    Now, we have come to the end of Unit 2. In this lesson, we explored the fundamental role of grammar in spoken English, focusing on building accuracy and confidence in forming correct sentences. We discussed the importance of sentence structure, particularly the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern, and how proper grammar usage enhances clarity in communication. Common grammatical mistakes were also highlighted, reinforcing the need for accuracy in both speech and writing. Applying these grammar rules correctly will help you express your thoughts more effectively, whether in casual conversations or professional settings.
