  summary: """
Now, we have come to the end of Unit 2. In this lesson, we explored the fundamental role of grammar in spoken English, focusing on building accuracy and confidence in forming correct sentences. We discussed the importance of sentence structure, particularly the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern, and how proper grammar usage enhances clarity in communication. Common grammatical mistakes were also highlighted, reinforcing the need for accuracy in both speech and writing. Applying these grammar rules correctly will help you express your thoughts more effectively, whether in casual conversations or professional settings.""",
