Welcome to Unit 2 – Lesson 2
This lesson will introduce the different types of sentences commonly used in spoken English. Understanding how different sentence types function will help you communicate clearly and effectively. Spoken English relies on a mix of sentence structures to convey meaning, express emotions, and engage in natural conversations. Before diving into the details, reflect on the way you speak. Do you vary your sentences when talking to different people? Recognizing different sentence types will help enhance your communication skills.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Identify and classify the four main types of sentences in spoken English.
2. Use different sentence structures to enhance fluency and natural speech.
3. Apply sentence variation in conversations to improve engagement and clarity.
