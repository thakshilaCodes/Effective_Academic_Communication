Our third unit is about tenses. Before exploring different tenses in future lessons, we first need to understand what tenses are and why they are important. Additionally, you should assess your own knowledge of tenses to identify which ones you struggle with.
This lesson focuses more on speaking skills. We will prioritize using tenses in speaking activities rather than writing because we understand how important it is for you to improve your spoken English.
At the beginning of the lesson, it is essential to understand what we aim to achieve by the end. This will help guide you and motivate you to actively participate in the activities. So, without further delay, let’s take a look at the lesson objectives.

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1.	Understand what tenses are and their role in indicating time in language.
2.	Discuss why understanding tenses is essential for clear and accurate communication.
3.	Identify the three main categories of tenses (past, present, and future) without going into detailed forms or structures.""",

Dear all, now that you have watched the recorded lecture, we have another video for you. This video, taken from BBC Learning English, will reinforce what you learned in the previous video.

Since you have now watched two videos on tenses, it’s time to take a quiz on mixed tenses and assess your strengths and weaknesses. This quiz is for self-awareness only—we will not check your marks.

After completing the quiz, take a screenshot of the final page showing your answers and upload it to the designated submission portal as proof of completion.""",
