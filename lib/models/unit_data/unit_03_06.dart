Hello and welcome! In this lesson, we will explore the past continuous tense—an essential grammar structure that helps you describe actions happening at a specific moment in the past. This tense is commonly used in spoken English to set the scene, tell stories, or explain interrupted actions.
Think about a time when you were in the middle of doing something. For example:
"I was watching a movie when the power went out."
Here, the past continuous tense (was watching) helps describe an action that was happening when another event interrupted it. The past continuous helps bring stories to life! It gives more detail about what was happening at a certain moment.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Understand the past continuous and when to use it.
2. Form past continuous sentences correctly.
3. Use past continuous in real-life conversations to describe past events.""",
