Hello everyone, welcome back! 
In todayâ€™s lesson, we will explore the past perfect continuous tense, a useful grammar structure that helps you describe actions that were happening over a period of time before another event in the past. This tense is commonly used in spoken English to explain how long something had been happening before another event interrupted it. Imagine you had been working on a project for hours when your computer crashed. You might say:
 "I had been working on my assignment for five hours when my laptop shut down."
Here, had been working (past perfect continuous) tells us that the action was happening over time before the laptop shut down (past simple).
Therefore, as the first step let's look at the lesson objectives of today's lesson.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Understand the past perfect continuous and when to use it.
2.	Form sentences correctly using this tense.
3.	Use past perfect continuous in real-life conversations.
