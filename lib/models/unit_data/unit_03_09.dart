Hello everyone, welcome back!
In today’s lesson, we will explore the future continuous tense, an essential structure used in English to describe ongoing actions that will be happening at a particular moment in the future. This tense is widely used in spoken English to express plans, predictions, and assumptions about future activities. It allows speakers to talk about scheduled activities and expectations in a more fluid and natural way. It also helps in making polite inquiries and emphasizing the duration of an activity at a given time in the future.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Understand the future continuous tense and when to use it.
2.	Form sentences correctly using this tense.
3.	Use future continuous tense in real-life conversations.
