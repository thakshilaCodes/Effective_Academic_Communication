Hello and welcome! In this lesson, we’ll explore the Future Perfect Tense—a fascinating structure that allows you to talk about actions that will be completed at a certain point in the future. This tense is especially useful when planning, forecasting, or tracking progress—things you often do in project management, software development, and computing tasks.

Imagine you’re managing a coding project, and you want to explain what will be finished before a deadline:
We will have completed the interface design by Friday.

Here, will have completed is the Future Perfect Tense. It shows that an action will be finished before another future moment. It’s like you’re predicting the past—from a future point of view!

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Understand the structure and uses of the Future Perfect tense.
2. Form sentences using will + have + past participle.
3. Use the tense confidently in tech-related spoken contexts.

Let’s jump in and start building your grammar for the future!""",
