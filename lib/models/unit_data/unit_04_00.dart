Hello everyone! Today marks the beginning of our fourth unit, "Essential Study Skills." As you have already started your undergraduate journey, this will be immensely helpful to you in your academic path. You may have done your schooling in Sinhala or Tamil, but now, you've reached a point where your university education must be conducted in English. You will attend lectures in English for 2–4 hours, where you need to grasp the main ideas and take all assessments in English. We understand that this transition from Sinhala/Tamil to English might cause communication challenges for some students. Therefore, this lesson is specifically designed to address these issues by offering strategies and techniques that you can incorporate into your studies. I hope this provides you with a brief yet clear understanding of the purpose of Unit 4. Now, let's look at the lesson objectives for this unit.
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Reflect on their existing strategies for understanding academic lectures.
2. Identify common challenges faced when listening to lectures in English.
3. Evaluate their approach to reviewing and organizing notes after a lecture.
4. Identify areas where they need improvement in vocabulary acquisition.
