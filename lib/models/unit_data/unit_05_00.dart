Hello everyone, welcome to Unit 5!
In this unit, we begin our journey into preparing for academic discussions and the viva voce. Academic discussions are formal conversations that require clarity, structure, and confidence, especially during a viva, where you are expected to explain, defend, and reflect on your work. As students in the computing field, you’ll often need to present technical ideas, justify decisions, and respond to critical questions.
This lesson helps you take the first step by focusing on how to express your ideas clearly and appropriately in academic conversations. We'll explore how to stay focused on a topic, respond with relevance, and use appropriate academic language. By strengthening these skills, you’ll be better prepared not just for your viva, but for teamwork, presentations, and interviews in your academic and professional journey.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Understand what academic discussion involves in a computing context
2. Identify the key features of effective participation in academic conversations
3. Recognize the importance of language, tone, and body language
4. Practice using academic phrases to express opinions and respond clearly""",

  summary: """
In this lesson, you were introduced to the foundations of academic discussion and how they relate to viva preparation. You learned that academic discussions are structured, formal, and goal-oriented conversations, where clarity, relevance, and respectful responses are key. We explored how to express opinions, clarify ideas, and use proper academic language in a computing context. Through video observation, interactive games, and speaking practice, you’ve begun to develop the confidence and skills needed for more complex discussions. These communication strategies are not only useful for viva exams but are essential in your academic journey and future career.
See you in the next lesson!""",

Great job completing the lesson!
Now that you've been introduced to academic discussions and learned how to express your ideas clearly and confidently, it’s time to put those skills into practice together. In our classroom session, we’ll engage in short viva-style conversations where you’ll respond to typical examiner questions using the academic phrases you’ve learned.
If you’re unsure about how to phrase something or need more practice expressing your ideas formally, bring your questions to class—we’ll tackle them together, and your lecturer will help you refine your answers.
Looking forward to hearing your voices and seeing your confidence grow in action!""",
