Hello and welcome!
In this lesson, we’ll explore what a viva voce is and how to prepare for it with confidence and clarity. A viva voce—often simply called a viva—is an oral examination where you present and defend your academic work, such as your final year project or research report. For computing undergraduates, this means explaining your code, decisions, methods, and even the bugs you fixed!
Unlike written exams, a viva requires you to think on your feet, express ideas fluently, and engage in a professional discussion. It’s not just about knowing your subject—it’s about communicating it effectively. You’ll be assessed on your technical understanding, clarity of explanation, and your ability to respond thoughtfully to questions. In this lesson, we’ll break down the purpose of a viva, typical structures, and common question types so you’ll know exactly what to expect—and how to shine!
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and format of a viva voce
2. Identify common types of viva questions and how to respond
3.	Practice introducing your project and defending key decisions
4.	Build confidence using academic and technical vocabulary in speech""",

  summary: """
You’ve now taken your first step into understanding the viva voce process. In this lesson, you learned what a viva is, why it's important, and what to expect in terms of structure and examiner interaction. We explored the types of questions typically asked—ranging from project explanations to justifying your decisions—and discussed how to respond with confidence and clarity. Through individual practice activities, you applied academic language to real-world scenarios, building both fluency and professionalism.
Being able to communicate your work is just as vital as doing the work itself. Whether you're presenting a project, debugging in front of a panel, or explaining a design choice, viva skills will help you thrive in your academic and professional journey.
Keep practicing—and remember, your voice is your strongest tool in a viva!""",

Well done on completing the lesson!

Now that you’ve explored the basics of the viva voce and how to respond professionally, we’ll bring those skills into the classroom. Get ready to participate in mini viva simulations, where you’ll answer questions about your project or a familiar topic in pairs or small groups.

If you have doubts or need help framing your responses, bring those questions with you—we’ll break them down together, and your lecturer will offer feedback on how to strengthen your delivery.

Let’s get you comfortable, confident, and ready to speak up in your viva!""",
