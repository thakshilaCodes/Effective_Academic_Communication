Dear all,
Questions play a significant role in leading a conversation. If no one asks a question, there is no communication happening. Thus, it’s vital to know the different types of questions we can use in various situations. The main focus of this lesson is to introduce and discuss different types of questions that we use in daily life when communicating with others.
Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.	Identify different types of questions (e.g., yes/no questions, WH-questions, tag questions, and indirect questions) and their functions in communication.
2.	Differentiate between open-ended and closed-ended questions based on their purpose and expected responses.
3.	Recognize the appropriate use of formal and informal questioning in different contexts (e.g., casual conversations vs. professional settings).
4.	Practice forming and using various question types correctly in spoken communication.
