Dear all,
In today's lesson, we will focus on the important skill of paraphrasing. As we covered summarizing in the previous lesson, you will find paraphrasing a bit easier. Paraphrasing allows you to rephrase information in your own words while keeping the original meaning intact. This skill is particularly useful in both academic and real-life conversations to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstanding.
Before we start the lesson, let’s take a moment to see the lesson objectives. By the end of this lesson, you should know exactly what you’re expected to achieve.

1.	Understand the importance of paraphrasing for effective communication and comprehension.
