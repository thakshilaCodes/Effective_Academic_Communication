  introductionText: """
In this unit, we‚Äôll explore how to expand your vocabulary using context. Words do not exist in isolation, they live in sentences, paragraphs, and conversations. By understanding how a word is used in a sentence, we can often guess its meaning, determine its tone, or choose a better alternative. This approach is especially useful in computing, where unfamiliar academic or technical terms are common. Whether you‚Äôre reading documentation, writing reports, or listening to lectures, context-based vocabulary development will help you decode meaning, use appropriate words, and improve your academic fluency.
This unit sets the foundation for future lessons, where we‚Äôll dive into how to change word forms, use context clues, distinguish between formal and informal expressions, and replace everyday words with academic equivalents. But first, let‚Äôs learn how to notice the clues all around a word‚Äîso we can truly understand and use it effectively.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Understand what context-based vocabulary development means.
2.	Recognize how surrounding words influence the meaning of unfamiliar terms.
3.	Practice identifying appropriate vocabulary based on sentence clues.
4.	Apply context awareness in reading, writing, and listening tasks.

  summary: """
In this lesson, you‚Äôve been introduced to context-based vocabulary development‚Äîa skill that allows you to learn and use new words more naturally by analyzing their surroundings. You‚Äôve seen how definitions, examples, synonyms, antonyms, and general logic in a sentence can provide clues about a word‚Äôs meaning. Instead of memorizing words in isolation, you now understand how to decode and retain vocabulary by observing how it functions in real-world texts. This skill is especially important in computing, where documentation, error messages, and reports are full of specialized terms. By using context to guide your understanding, you‚Äôll build a more flexible and adaptive vocabulary that supports academic success and professional communication.""",

In our classroom session, we‚Äôll take this further by analyzing technical paragraphs from real computing texts‚Äîsuch as user manuals, API documentation, and research abstracts. You‚Äôll work individually to underline unfamiliar words and interpret their meanings based on context. Then, you‚Äôll share your conclusions with a partner or the class and justify your reasoning. This hands-on analysis will help reinforce what you‚Äôve learned and prepare you to approach future readings with confidence. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre unsure‚Äîthis is your chance to practice and ask questions. Let‚Äôs build your vocabulary toolbox together!
