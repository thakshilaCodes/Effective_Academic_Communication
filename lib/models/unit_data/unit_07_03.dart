  introductionText: """
Hello everyone, welcome to lesson 7.3!
In this unit, we’ll explore how to recognize and use formal and informal expressions in your communication. Every context, whether academic, professional, or casual—requires a different tone. In computing, you might speak casually during a team meeting but use formal language in documentation, emails, or presentations. Being able to switch between formal and informal expressions is a key communication skill that helps you sound appropriate and professional.
As future IT professionals, you’ll need to write emails to clients, contribute in technical reports, chat with colleagues, or present projects to an audience. Each of these scenarios demands the right level of formality. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to identify tones, replace informal words with formal ones, and adjust your language to suit academic and technical environments.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Identify formal and informal expressions in English.
2.	Distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate tone in academic and professional settings.
3.	Replace informal expressions with formal ones, especially in computing-related communication.
4.	Apply the correct level of formality in writing and speaking tasks.

Imagine you are preparing to present your final-year project. You recorded your speech informally, but now you need to revise it to sound formal and academic. Use at least 3 formal expressions you learned in the video. Follow the steps given below.

Write a short informal version of your project intro (4-5 lines). 

Example:
“Hey, so we made this really cool tool that helps people code faster.”

Record your informal version using given tool, copy the record link and paste here. 

Then record your formal version using the same link and paste that link here as well. 

2 record links should be submitted.

  summary: """
In this lesson, you learned the importance of selecting the right tone in your communication. Whether you are speaking with a classmate, emailing a lecturer, or documenting your work, understanding the difference between formal and informal expressions helps you communicate more clearly and appropriately. You practiced identifying tone, replacing casual words with formal equivalents, and even transformed your own speech. This skill is especially valuable in the computing field, where emails, presentations, and reports often require a polished, professional tone. By mastering this balance, you’ll not only sound more confident but also build credibility in academic and workplace settings.""",

  inClassActivity: """
In class, you’ll be given different communication scenarios: writing an email to a supervisor, chatting in a team meeting, or reporting a bug in a project presentation. You’ll work individually to rewrite informal statements into formal ones (and vice versa), and then explain why the change was needed. We’ll also role-play short conversations where you’ll practice switching tone depending on the audience. This is your chance to build fluency and adapt your voice to different real-life computing situations. Don’t worry about making mistakes—we’re here to learn together and polish your professional communication style!""",
