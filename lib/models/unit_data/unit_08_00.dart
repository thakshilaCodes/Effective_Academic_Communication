Imagine you are in a discussion about the pros and cons of using artificial intelligence tools for study purposes. 

Step 1: Try to first write the pros and cons based on your thoughts.

Step 2: Use ChatGPT and give this prompt:
“I want to have a discussion about the pros and cons of using artificial intelligence tools for study purposes. Can you start the conversation?”
Have a discussion about this topic with ChatGPT, and evaluate your own participation. Did you use signposts and transitions effectively? How well did you structure your ideas during the conversation? 

Step 3: Take a screenshot of your conversation and submit it to the portal given as the proof of the completion of the activity.
