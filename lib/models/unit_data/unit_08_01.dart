Hello everyone!
Welcome to the first lesson of Unit 8, Organizing Thoughts Before Speaking or Writing. Whether you're preparing for an academic discussion, presentation, or essay, having a clear and logical structure is essential. Many learners often find themselves struggling not because they lack ideas, but because they find it difficult to organize their thoughts effectively. This lesson is designed to introduce you to practical strategies like mind mapping and outlining, which can make a big difference in both your speaking and writing skills. Letâ€™s explore how to turn our scattered ideas into structured communication!

Before we start the lesson, take a few moments to reflect:

Think about a time when you had to speak or write about a topic with very little preparation.

In a short paragraph (3â€“5 sentences), answer the following:

â€¢	What strategies or techniques did you use to organize your thoughts in that situation?

â€¢	Was it easy or challenging?

â€¢	Would you approach it differently now?

ðŸ‘‰ Please share your response in the discussion forum. 

Then, watch the following video and reflect on the differences between an effective and ineffective presentation:

Itâ€™s time to try organizing your ideas visually! Mind maps are a great way to brainstorm and structure your thoughts.

Step 1: Choose a topic (e.g., climate change, education, or technology).

Step 2: Create a mind map. Place the topic in the center and draw branches for subtopics or supporting ideas.

Step 3: Take a screenshot of your completed mind map and upload it to the learning portal.

(You can use pen and paper or any online tool like MindMup, Coggle, etc.)

Now, letâ€™s try outlining your ideas in a more structured way.

Step 1: Choose a topic you want to speak about.

Step 2: Create a simple outline using the structure below:

â€¢	Introduction â€“ Brief overview of your topic

â€¢	Body â€“ Three key points or arguments
Point 1
Point 2
Point 3

â€¢	Conclusion â€“ Summary or final thoughts

Step 3: Using your outline, record a short 2-minute oral presentation via Zoom or any recording tool. Try to speak naturally and avoid reading word-by-word. Upload the recording as proof of completion. You can first upload the recording to the drive and attach the drive link to the submission portal, if it doesnâ€™t allow you to upload the video.
