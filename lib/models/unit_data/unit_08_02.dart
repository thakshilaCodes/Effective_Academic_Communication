Introduction
Hello everyone! 
In our previous lesson, we looked at how to organize our thoughts before writing or speaking, using tools like mind mapping and outlining. Today, we're going one step further to explore a powerful technique to help you present your ideas clearly and logically—both in speaking and in writing.
This method is called the Point-Evidence-Explanation (P-E-E) method. It’s a simple yet effective way to build strong academic arguments and communicate clearly. Once you learn it, you’ll notice how it improves the quality of your responses—whether you're writing a paragraph, answering a question, or participating in a discussion.
Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
1.	Understand what the "P-E-E" method is and why it is useful in academic discussions and writing.
2.	Identify the three key components—Point, Evidence, and Explanation—in written examples.
3.	Apply the "P-E-E" method to structure your own responses logically and effectively.

Let’s now look at an example paragraph and break it down into its three parts: Point, Evidence, and Explanation.

Read the paragraph below and identify which sentence represents the Point, which is the Evidence, and which is the Explanation.

“Regular exercise is essential for maintaining good mental health. A study by Harvard Medical School found that people who exercise at least 30 minutes a day have a 40% lower risk of depression. This is because physical activity releases endorphins, which improve mood and reduce stress.”

Step 1: Write down your answers.

Step 2: Share your response in the discussion forum.

Looking forward to seeing you in class! 
We will be doing some interactive activities where you will:
•	Work in pairs or small groups to identify and write P-E-E paragraphs.
•	Practice speaking using the P-E-E method in short oral discussions.
Let’s make this a fun and productive session together!
