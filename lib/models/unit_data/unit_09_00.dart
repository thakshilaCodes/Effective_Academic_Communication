Welcome back! 
Did you know? Academic presentations are more than just talking in front of a screen—they’re a powerful way to share your ideas, research, or solutions with an audience? 
In computing, you might present a project, explain how an algorithm works, or pitch a new app design. This lesson introduces the basics of academic presentations: what they are, why they matter, and how they’re different from casual speaking. You’ll explore how to engage your audience, use clear language, and present your content with confidence. Whether you’re new to public speaking or just want to level up your skills, this is the perfect place to begin. This unit lays the groundwork for upcoming lessons where we’ll discuss in detail about where effective presentation structure, strategies to manage nervousness, and how to make your delivery stand out. Let’s start your presentation journey here.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Understand the purpose and key features of academic presentations.
2.	Identify the differences between casual and academic speaking.
3.	Recognize the expectations of an academic audience.
4.	Apply basic techniques to plan and prepare an academic presentation.
