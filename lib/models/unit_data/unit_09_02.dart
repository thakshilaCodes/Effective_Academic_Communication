  introductionText: """
Hello everyone, Welcome to Unit 9.2 
Almost everyone feels nervous before a presentation—even experienced speakers. Your heart races, your palms sweat, and suddenly, the words you practiced vanish. But the good news is: anxiety is normal, and it can be managed. In this lesson, you’ll learn simple, science-backed tips to reduce presentation anxiety so you can focus on what really matters—sharing your ideas with clarity and confidence.
As computing students, you’ll often present your projects, research, or code explanations in front of peers, lecturers, or even panels. This lesson will help you prepare mentally and emotionally by giving you practical strategies like breathing techniques, rehearsal methods, body language tips, and positive mindset tools. Let’s take the fear out of speaking—step by step.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Understand the causes and effects of presentation anxiety.
2.	Apply strategies to calm your mind and body before speaking.
3.	Use preparation techniques to increase confidence.
4.	Practice body language and vocal tools to feel more in control.

Watch the video lesson carefully to explore why we feel nervous before speaking and how to manage it effectively. The video will cover real tips used by professionals and students—like power posing, mental rehearsal, and controlled breathing. You’ll also learn how to shift your focus from fear to purpose.
Take notes during the video where you hear something that you’d like to try or where you relate to a speaker's experience. Your notes will be useful for the quiz and practice activities later.

  summary: """
In this lesson, you learned that presentation anxiety is a normal and manageable experience. We explored what causes nerves—like fear of forgetting, judgment, or failure—and learned practical ways to handle those feelings. Whether it’s breathing deeply, repeating calming thoughts, rehearsing your opening line, or visualizing success, small changes can make a big difference. You also practiced shifting negative thoughts into empowering ones, focusing on your message rather than your fear.
As computing students, your ability to present clearly is just as important as writing code or running simulations. With preparation and mindset tools, you can turn anxiety into energy and speak with confidence. Keep practicing your calm-down strategies, you’re on your way to becoming a more confident speaker!""",

  inClassActivity: """
Now that you’ve completed this lesson, it’s time to apply what you’ve learned in a real situation. In our classroom session, we will do some engaging activities that will help you reduce your nervousness. 
Always remember, before presenting any presentation, take a minute to practice one calming strategy from your “Chill Checklist.” Then, deliver your speech while focusing on your breathing and mindset. Moreover, during the classroom sessions, your lecturer will give you gentle feedback and help you reflect on what worked well and what you can improve. Don’t worry, we’re all here to support each other and grow together. You’ve got this!
