Dear all,
Welcome to Unit 10! In this unit, we will focus on enhancing the coherence and logical flow of your spoken presentations. While having great ideas is important, it’s essential to present them in an organized way, so your audience can easily follow your message. Effective speakers guide their listeners through their presentations with clear transitions, signposting, and logical sequencing. This unit includes two lessons designed to help you build rapport with your audience and refine your presentation delivery.
Let’s take a look at what you will achieve by the end of this lesson.
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.	Identify key strategies to improve coherence in spoken presentations.
2.	Use signposting language effectively to guide the audience.
3.	Structure ideas logically to maintain clarity and engagement.
4.	Apply transitions and linking phrases to create a smooth flow.

  practiceActivityDescription1: """ 
Now that you have an understanding of how to maintain the logical flow of a presentation, it's time to practice at home.

Step 1: Choose one of the following presentation topics:
•	The benefits of regular exercise
•	The impact of social media on communication
•	How artificial intelligence is changing the workplace

Step 2: Create a PowerPoint presentation with 3 slides covering the main points of your chosen topic. The slides should include:
1.	Slide 1 – Introduction: Introduce your topic and main message.
2.	Slide 2 – Main Points: Present 2–3 key points supporting your topic.
3.	Slide 3 – Conclusion: Summarize the main takeaways and conclude your presentation.

Step 3: Once your slides are ready, use PowerPoint’s Presenter Coach feature to practice delivering your presentation. Here’s how to use it:
1.	In PowerPoint, go to the Slide Show tab.
2.	Click on Rehearse with Coach.
3.	Follow the instructions to begin practicing your presentation. As you speak, PowerPoint will listen to your delivery and provide real-time feedback on pacing, filler words, and clarity.
4.	After completing your practice session, review the feedback report generated by PowerPoint. It will show areas where you can improve, such as speaking too fast, too slow, or using too many filler words.

Step 4: Take a screenshot of the best attempt of your PowerPoint Coach report, showing your performance and the feedback.

Step 5: Upload the screenshot of your report to the portal.
