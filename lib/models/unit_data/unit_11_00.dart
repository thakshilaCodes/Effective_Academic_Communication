Hello, future computing professionals!
Oral exams and viva voce sessions can feel a little intimidating, can‚Äôt they? You're asked to speak clearly, explain your work, and respond on the spot. But here‚Äôs a secret: you can totally master them with the right tools and mindset! In this lesson, we‚Äôll focus on how to prepare for and ace your viva by organizing your thoughts, using academic language, and showing confidence‚Äîeven when you feel nervous inside.
In computing fields, you're often asked to justify your decisions‚Äîwhether it's your choice of algorithm, programming logic, or system design. The viva isn‚Äôt just about what you know, but how well you can explain and defend your knowledge. This lesson will help you sound more professional, calm, and structured during your oral assessments. By the end, you‚Äôll be well on your way to becoming a viva pro!
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Understand how to structure a strong oral response.
2.	Use polite and academic phrases to agree, disagree, and clarify.
3.	Present your technical decisions clearly and confidently.
4.	Practice techniques to manage anxiety and stay calm under pressure.

Watch the video lesson carefully to understand what a viva voce is and how it differs from everyday question-and-answer sessions. The video will explain the structure, tone, and types of questions typically asked in an oral exam, especially in computing-related disciplines. You‚Äôll see how students explain their decisions, clarify misunderstandings, and handle unexpected questions.
Feel free to take notes‚Äîespecially when you hear helpful phrases, sentence starters, or expressions that sound natural and professional. These can become powerful tools in your own responses during future vivas. Pay attention to both what is said and how it‚Äôs said‚Äîtone, body language, and pacing are just as important as the content!
