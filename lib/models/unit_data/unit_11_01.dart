Hey everyone! Let’s talk about speaking up—with confidence and clarity!
Ever had a moment where you knew the answer, but your voice got shaky or your words didn’t come out right? Don’t worry, it happens to all of us. But here’s the good news: clear, confident speaking isn’t a talent you’re born with—it’s a skill you can build. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to organize your thoughts, use strong and clear language, and sound more confident when you speak—whether it’s in a classroom, a meeting, or even an interview.
In the computing world, how you explain your ideas is just as important as the ideas themselves. Whether you're presenting your final-year project, pitching a new app, or joining a team meeting, you'll need to speak in a way that others understand and respect. This lesson will help you get there, step by step!
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Use techniques to sound more confident when speaking.
2.	Organize your ideas clearly and express them smoothly.
3.	Recognize and avoid common habits that make speech unclear.
4.	Practice building stronger body language and voice tone.
