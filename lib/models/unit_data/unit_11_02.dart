  introductionText: """
Hi everyone!
Imagine this: you’re in a viva or an oral exam, answering confidently… and suddenly, the examiner asks a question that completely catches you off guard. What now? Do you freeze? Guess? Or can you take a breath, stay calm, and respond smartly?
This lesson is all about helping you handle difficult and unexpected questions with confidence. Whether the question is too technical, off-topic, or something you’ve never thought about, you can still give a strong response by using the right strategies and language. Together, we’ll explore how to buy time, reframe tricky questions, and stay calm under pressure—all while keeping your tone polite and academic. These skills are incredibly useful not only in viva exams, but also in job interviews, presentations, and even team meetings in your future career.
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Recognize different types of challenging or unexpected questions.
2.	Use strategies to stay calm and composed when unsure.
3.	Politely ask for clarification or rephrase your answer.
4.	Use sentence starters and phrases to structure your response clearly.

Watch the video lesson carefully to understand how to deal with difficult and unexpected questions in academic settings. The video will walk you through common question types, how to stay calm, and how to respond with confidence even when you're unsure. You’ll also see examples of both strong and weak responses.
Feel free to pause and take notes when you hear useful phrases or techniques. Look out for tips on tone, structure, and body language—especially how to sound thoughtful instead of panicking. These phrases can become part of your toolkit for oral exams and beyond.

  summary: """
In this lesson, you explored how to handle those tricky, unpredictable questions that often come up in oral exams and discussions. Whether the question was unclear, outside your preparation, or just plain tough—you now have strategies to stay calm, clarify the question, buy thinking time, and still respond confidently. Through scenario-based games and practical phrase building, you learned to recover from small mistakes and keep your tone respectful and academic. These strategies are valuable not just in your viva, but anytime you're under pressure to speak intelligently. Remember: staying calm is a skill—and you’re learning it well!""",

  inClassActivity: """
Now that you’ve completed the lesson, it’s time to sharpen these skills in our classroom session. When we meet in person, we’ll practice how to respond to unexpected or challenging questions using the techniques and phrases you've just learned.
If any parts of the lesson felt confusing or if you’d like help practicing a specific response, bring your notes and your questions to class. Your lecturer will be ready to guide you, give feedback, and help you build stronger, clearer answers. There’s no pressure to be perfect, this is your opportunity to learn and grow together.
