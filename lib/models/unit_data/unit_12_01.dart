Hello everyone!
Welcome to our first lesson in Unit 12. Today, we’re diving into something incredibly important—Self-Assessment & Reflection. It might sound like a big idea, but at its core, it's just about taking a moment to pause and think:
•	How am I doing as a communicator?
•	What am I already doing well?
•	What could I do better?
Have you ever finished a presentation or a discussion and thought, “That went well, but I could’ve improved that one part”? That’s exactly what we’re going to focus on—recognizing strengths, identifying areas for growth, and setting meaningful personal goals to develop your academic communication skills.
Let’s start!
Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.	Understand the importance of self-assessment in improving academic communication.
2.	Reflect on your strengths and areas for improvement in communication.
3.	Use self-reflection to set personal goals for continuous growth.

Step 1: Reflect on one area of communication that you'd like to improve. (e.g., Clarity, confidence, reducing filler words, managing nerves, etc.)

Step 2: Set a SMART goal to improve that area.

For example:
“I will reduce the use of filler words in my presentations by practicing a 5-minute speech every day for the next week.” If you don’t have an idea about setting SMART goals, please watch the video below. 

Step 3: Share your reflection and SMART goal in the class discussion forum.
